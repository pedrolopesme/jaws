# JAWS: The JWT Swiss Army Knife

![alt text](image.png)

## Objective

JAWS is a command-line tool that helps you decode and inspect JWT tokens. It's like a Swiss Army knife for JWTs, giving you the power to:

ðŸ‘‰ Decode JWT tokens and print their content in a human-readable format

ðŸ‘‰ Validate JWT signatures using a signing key

ðŸ‘‰ Print the header and body of a JWT token separately

## How to Use

To use JAWS, simply install it using go get and then run the jaws decode command followed by the JWT token you want to decode. For example:

```bash
$ go get github.com/pedrolopeme/jaws
$ jaws decode <JWT ENCODED TOKEN>
```

JAWS will then print the decoded JWT token to the terminal:
